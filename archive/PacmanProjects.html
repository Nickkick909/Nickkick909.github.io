        <p>The Pacman Projects are from my Artificial Intelligence class at UofSC.
            <br>These projects were to help Pacman navigate his maze world.
            <br>The first project was a searching problem to help him find the closest food.
            <br>The next one involved Pacman finding food while avoiding ghosts.
            <br>Third project was about reinforcement learning.
            <br>Pacman was given several tries, and each time he improved and updated his knowledge.
            <br>Here are videos from the first 2 projects 
            <br>(the 3rd would be boring since he takes many tries to learn).
