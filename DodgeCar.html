        <p>
            Dodge Car was my project for winter break 2018.
            <br>This is a game I created using C# and Unity.
            <br>You are a little car on a long platform, and you have to dodge obstacles.
            <br>If you make it to the end of the level you get to move on.
            <br>There are 10 hand built levels for you to navigate.
            <br>The levels increase in difficultly as you progress.
            <br>I also made an installer for Windows and Mac.
