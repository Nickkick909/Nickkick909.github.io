        <p>The Pacman Projects are from my Artificial Intelligence class at UofSC.
            <br>The projects in this class let us write algorithms to help Pacman navigate his maze.
            <br>The first project was a searching problem to help him find the closest food.
            <br>The next one involved Pacman finding food while avoiding ghosts.
            <br>Basically, we were trying to get him to win games and get the highest score.
            <br>Third project was about reinforcement learning.
            <br>Pacman was given several tries, and each time he improved and updated his knowledge.
